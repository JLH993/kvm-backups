# kvm-backups
Use to back up powered off VMs on your KVM host, going to add functionality to safely backup running VMs in the future.

Personally, would recommend throwing this in your crontab and letting it run weekly or however often you need. Note that until I add functionality for backups of running VMs, you will need to do those seperately.
